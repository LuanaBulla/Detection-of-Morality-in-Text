### General Information
The theory of moral foundations (MFT) is a socio-cognitive psychological theory that constitutes a general framework aimed at explaining the origin and evolution of human moral reasoning. Because of its dyadic structure of values and their violations, it can be used as a theoretical background for discerning moral values from natural language text as it captures a user's perspective on a specific topic. In this repository, we offer tools to perform an automatic detection of moral content in sentences or short paragraphs using machine learning techniques.

### Supervised Models
- The [MFTC Classifier.py](https://github.com/LuanaBulla/Detection-of-Morality-in-Text/blob/main/MoralClassifier.py) is a Bert-based multi-label classifier fine-tuned on the [Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus (MFTC)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619876629), a dataset of tweets annotated with MFT labels. For additional details, please refer to [Detection of Morality in Tweets Based on the Moral Foundation Theory](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-25599-1_1).
- The [MFRC Classifier.py](https://github.com/LuanaBulla/Detection-of-Morality-in-Text/blob/main/MFRC%20Classifier.py) is a Bert-based multi-label classifier fine-tuned on the [Moral Foundation Reddit Corpus (MFRC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05545). This dataset comprises Reddit comments annotated with MFT foundations. For more comprehensive information, please consult the paper [Do Language Models Understand Morality? Towards a Robust Detection of the Moral Content]().

### Unsupervised Models
- The [NLI_0shot.py](https://github.com/LuanaBulla/Detection-of-Morality-in-Text/blob/main/NLI_0shot.py) is a zero-shot multi-label classifier built upon the MFT labels using a Natural Language Inference (NLI) system. This NLI model indirectly acquires common-sense knowledge, enabling it to detect core values in the input text solely through semantic interpretation based on MFT label taxonomies. For a more comprehensive understanding of the methodology, please consult references [Uncovering values: detecting latent moral content from natural language with explainable and non-trained methods](https://aclanthology.org/2022.deelio-1.4/) and [Do Language Models Understand Morality? Towards a Robust Detection of the Moral Content]().

### Data
The [Data](https://github.com/LuanaBulla/Detection-of-Morality-in-Text/tree/main/Data) folder contains the three subcorpora derived from the MFRC dataset: Subcorpus A (Everyday Moral Life), Subcorpus B (US Politics), and Subcorpus C (French Politics). Prior to use, this data underwent preprocessing with specific rules: we combined the labels "Equality" and "Proportionality" into the broader moral category of "Fairness," omitted the label "Thin Morality," and identified items consistently labeled as having no moral value by the majority of annotators. Consequently, these items were exclusively associated with the "non-moral" label. For a more comprehensive explanation, please refer to the paper [Do Language Models Understand Morality? Towards a Robust Detection of the Moral Content]().

### Results
The [Results](https://github.com/LuanaBulla/Detection-of-Morality-in-Text/tree/main/Results) folder contains the results of the NLI-based zero-shot approach on the three subcorpora of the MFRC. Additionally, the files report predictions of moral values generated by the Da Vinci GPT-3 model, as well as moral labels assigned using supervised approaches involving multi-label RoBERTa classifiers.
