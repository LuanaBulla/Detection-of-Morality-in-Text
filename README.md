### General Information
The theory of moral foundations (MFT) is a socio-cognitive psychological theory that constitutes a general framework aimed at explaining the origin and evolution of human moral reasoning. Because of its dyadic structure of values and their violations, it can be used as a theoretical background for discerning moral values from natural language text as it captures a user's perspective on a specific topic. In this repository, we offer tools to perform an automatic detection of moral content in sentences or short paragraphs using machine learning techniques.

### Supervised Models
- [MFTC Classifier.py](https://github.com/LuanaBulla/Detection-of-Morality-in-Text/blob/main/MoralClassifier.py) is a Bert-based multi-label classifier fine-tuned on the Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus (MFTC), a dataset of tweets annotated with MFT labels. For additional details, please refer to [Detection of Morality in Tweets Based on the Moral Foundation Theory](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-25599-1_1).
