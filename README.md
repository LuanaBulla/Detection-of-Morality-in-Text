# Detection-of-Morality-in-Text
The theory of moral foundations is a socio-cognitive psychological theory that constitutes a general framework aimed at explaining the origin and evolution of human moral reasoning. Because of its dyadic structure of values and their violations, it can be used as a theoretical background for discerning moral values from natural language text as it captures a user's perspective on a specific topic. In this repository, we offer tools to perform an automatic detection of moral content in sentences or short paragraphs using machine learning techniques.
