"You are correct. Le Pen is still part of a nazi party. So, a fascist and a nazi.",Fairness
well their main thing is anti-immigration like Trump / Wilders / Le Pen,non-moral
Macron is good precisely because he isn't a populist. He has actually good policies that don't make economists want to vomit.,Authority
"French don't have to work 2-3 jobs, they restrict employers from forcing they employees to overwork. In fact, current government wants to change that to enslave them. Probably Macron will finalize this process.

So French actually have time and energy to go to vote. (Sorry US Slaves, I think you would not know the difference)

Also , everything is accessible walking distance/public transportation/bike in France, unlike US.",Fairness
"+1 Hamon is a fine man, at least he got some nice ideas into the public discourse - UBI, taxing robots, etc.

"Not all of them do, just those who identify with Steve Bannon's right-wing nationalistic ideology.  They consider themselves part of an international movement that includes Farage, Le Penn, etc.  Because they are nationalists, they oppose any supranational organization that takes away even a tiny fraction of its member states' sovereignty.  They are also very anti-Muslim and anti-immigration/refugees, and they view the EU as enabling those things.",Fairness

"For France, Macron is quite right on the economic front. Of the five candidates, only Fillion could be described as more conservative.

LePen often attacks immigrants.

&gt; Le Pen's immunity has been lifted before, in 2013, by the EU parliament.

According to The Wall Street Journal, overall turnout for this election is projected to be the lowest since [1969](https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/861250995048914945?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet).

I would never vote for FPÖ, Le Pen or similar. I've always voted pro-EU and expect to do that in October again. But I am seriously tired of the endless pro-EU circlejerk on this sub and the name calling and shaming of anyone who doesn't blindly follow the r/europe righteous dogma 24/7.",non-moral
"Valls is way ahead unfortunately. Seems quite backwards, the socialists will essentially mean their only choices are right wing and extreme right wing. If Macron gets through to the second round at least they can vote for a centrist candidate.",non-moral
Oh rubbish. She got 23% in the first round and it was unlikely she would gain another 20%. From whom? The hard left voters? The Fillon supporters?,non-moral
"It's ""good"" timing for Islamist terrorism. Generating fear right before the election inevitably helps Le Pen's vote share; reinforces moderate French Muslims' feelings of alienation, creates new Islamists to help forward the Islamist agenda.","Fairness, Care"

well, if you think that Jean Marie Le Pen was a fighter in Algeria, you understand why Macron's statement was used against him.

How does it feel to know that your antisemitic piece of trash lost to God emperor Macron?,Fairness
"Except Macrons party has no local election members and the Les Republicans get major cabinet positions. Remember Fillion was averaging 28% in the first round until scandal but he still ended up with 20% of the vote nearly. His 20% are worth much more than the Socialists 6% yesterday.

Hollande is polling at 10% popularity while Macron has promised to roll back major economic reforms Hollande has made.",non-moral
"Yes, but I don't think that's why people voted against him. Wilders gave zero practical solutions to the problems that every day citizens face. He complained, and that's all he did. Basically this arguments boiled down to 'the Muslims are the problem', it didn't matter what the issue was. The economy? Muslims are the problem. Crime? Muslims are the problem. Poverty? Muslims are the problem. Thankfully, ordinary citizens saw right through his bullshit, and realized he had zero real solutions.

Hopefully, this will embolden anti-fascists across the EU, and the likes of Le Pen will lose big time.",Fairness

My point is that Neoliberal ideology and economic policy tends to veer towards these misadventures almost inevitably.
Macron's campaign reminds me a lot of Blair and Obama during their first elections, Before people started to wise up to what their real priorities were.

Besides, Clinton had a fairly moderate right-leaning platform.  Le Pen is radical right.  Not really relatable.",Fairness

Hitler tailored a propagandized hatred against the Jews, and killed millions and millions of Jews, homosexuals and disabled people by working them to death in concentration camps, and immediately killing them in extermination camps. Stalin killed millions of fellow Soviet men, all because they showed signs of disagreement with him, and starved millions in a famine he caused.

there's still a small chance she'll actually win. Biggest chance is macron. Le Pen has a big fanbase so in the first round she might win.
